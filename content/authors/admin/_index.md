I am currently a Research Scientist at Facebook AI. Before that I was a 4th-year doctoral researcher in the [Natural Language Processing Group](https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/nlpgroup/) at Heidelberg University and [Research Training Group "AIPHES"](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/aiphes/aiphes/index.en.jsp) where I worked on incorporating external knowledge into neural networks for question answering and reading comprehension. In Spring 2018 I was a Research Intern at the [AI2 Aristo Team](https://allenai.org/aristo/) in Seattle. In Summer 2017 I was a Research Scientist Intern at [Amazon AI](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/amazonai) in Palo Alto.
